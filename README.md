# ML-Romanian-Moldavian-Encrypted-Tweets
The purpose of this project (created using Google Colab) is to classify encrypted tweets by dialect into either Moldovian or Romanian language. This is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions. We will try different aproaches in order to observ which one is better for our dataset.
